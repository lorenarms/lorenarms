## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>
  I'm Lawrence, and I'm transitioning into software development as a career! It's something I've been interested in since I was just a young lad, and now that I'm a grown up I'm excited to begin a new chapter of my life in the profession. Currently I am the lead programmer and engineer at a Las Vegas escape room franchise, and I spend my free time honing my problem-solving skills through software solutions.

## Projects and Curiosities
### [Machine Learning Explorations](https://github.com/lorenarms/Machine_Learning)

<p>
Lately I've been getting interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, so to practice I built a few models and trained them on some various data sets. I wanted to explore categorical and regressive data types, and even a little bit of unstructured data in the form of image recognition. All of the models were built in Jupyter Notebooks using the SciKitLearn library. I'm also working on a repo of just data visualizations, but that one isn't ready yet so for now, enjoy these!

### [Generic Social Dating App](https://github.com/lorenarms/DatingApp2023)

<p>
  This project was built while following a course online. The course guided students through development process, using best practices for clean code and the latest methodologies in designing applications. The entire SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) was exemplified in the course, including testing, deployment, and support. The project took about six weeks to complete.

### [Messenger and Video Player](https://github.com/lorenarms/PanIQVideoPlayer_V2)

<p>
This application was commisioned by my current employer and developed by just me, a developer team of one. In the escape rooms, players are dropped off by hosts and then shown a brief video about the room they are about to play. This application facilitates that showing, allowing game masters in the control room to play the video remotely, without interfering with any other network traffic or gameplay flow. The application connects over the network via a TCP connection, allowing the game master to start the video remotely. The video plays for the players in the room, and when finishes, self-closes the application and returns to the main game screen.

### [Escape Room Hint Database](https://github.com/lorenarms/PanIQ_HintDB)

<p>
Before I developed this application, the escape room manager used a simple google sheet to tally hints and glitches that happened in the escape rooms. There was a fresh sheet for each week, and after being open for a year a half that added up to a lot of un-queryable data. I took on this project as a side-quest, developing an ASP.NET web application that stored new data into a SQL database for the manager. The input form uses some JQuery to dynamically load options in the drowdown menus, making data entry much faster for game masters while they manage multiple games. The UI also incorporates DataTables to display the database entries, allowing for easy searching and querying.
